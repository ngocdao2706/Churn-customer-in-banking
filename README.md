# Churn-customer-in-banking
This is a classification problem in which we use a real dataset from a local commercial bank in Vietnam. We perform some tasks like EDA, cleaning data, build and test model to find out which one will be the best in prediction churn customer.
Along the way, we also discover some interesting inside from the dataset
Unfortunately, due to the privacy of the bank, we can't public the dataset
This is our first project in machine learning with Python
